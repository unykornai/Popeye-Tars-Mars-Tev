# Unykorn L1 — Trademark Policy

**Version**: 1.0.0  
**Effective Date**: February 2026

---

## Overview

This document defines the rules for using the **Unykorn** name, logos, and component names (POPEYE, TEV, MARS, TAR, Consensus) in connection with the Unykorn L1 blockchain runtime.

The Unykorn L1 source code is open source under the MIT License. **This trademark policy does not restrict your rights under that license.** You can freely use, modify, and distribute the code.
